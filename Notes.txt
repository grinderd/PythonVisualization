Purpose: The intention of this project is to design a broad discussion of data visualization for python through
examining how the matplotlib and seaborn packages work

==================================================
General notes about presentation:

Should do comparison with ggplot and SAS.

What visualizations currently exist?  Talk to people in risk management about what typical plots they produce.  Also
talk to Greg/others in reporting about what visualizations they typically do
- Could get SAS code from them to use in presentation

Does marketing have any guidance on presentation pallets?  Are their standard pallets that should be used when
developing?

Exercises:
- Manipulating the parameters of the plot
- Based on the book
- Use a common data set or give a way to generate the data
- Could we use some os commnands to grab data off the computer they are using?


Outline:

1. What "are" visualizations in Python?  What important technology is being leveraged?  How are visualizations rendered?
  How does this change on different systems?

1. Why do we use visualizations?  What best practices should be followed?  What theories exist (Gramar of Graphics)?

2. Examples of plots:
A. Line plot
B. Histogram
C. Correlation matrix
D. Heat Map
E. Time series data (?)

2. Tasks associated with data visualization
- Useful visualizations in data cleaning/understanding
- Modeling diagnostics (ROC/Percision recall curve)
    - What does Sci-Kit Learn or H20 use?

3. Manipulating the basic visualization:
- axis
- legend
- title
- mutliple dimensionality
- facetting graphs
